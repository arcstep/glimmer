          Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date*
          axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick)
          where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100,
          1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick
          to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5),
          or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L<f>*, where `f` is
          a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position).
          For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6,
          1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all
          digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If
          the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds.
          For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to
          86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M<n>* gives ticks spaced by
          a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the
          15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*.
          To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

      `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other
      user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible`
      is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled
      by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config:
      {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
      tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided.
      So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such
      that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven
      changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.'
