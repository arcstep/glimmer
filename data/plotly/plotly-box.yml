      We add two items to d3''s date formatter: *%h* for half of the year as a decimal
      number as well as *%{n}f* for fractional seconds with n digits. For example,
      *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with tickformat *%H~%M~%S.%2f* would display *09~15~23.46*By

  description: 'Each box spans from quartile 1 (Q1) to quartile 3 (Q3). The second
    quartile (Q2, i.e. the median) is marked by a line inside the box. The fences
    grow outward from the boxes'' edges, by default they span +/- 1.5 times the interquartile
    range (IQR: Q3-Q1), The sample mean and standard deviation as well as notches
    and the sample, outlier and suspected outliers points can be optionally added
    to the box plot. The values and positions corresponding to each boxes can be input
    using two signatures. The first signature expects users to supply the sample values
    in the `y` data array for vertical boxes (`x` for horizontal boxes). By supplying
    an `x` (`y`) array, one box per distinct `x` (`y`) value is drawn If no `x` (`y`)
    {array} is provided, a single box is drawn. In this case, the box is positioned
    with the trace `name` or with `x0` (`y0`) if provided. The second signature expects
    users to supply the boxes corresponding Q1, median and Q3 statistics in the `q1`,
    `median` and `q3` data arrays respectively. Other box features relying on statistics
    namely `lowerfence`, `upperfence`, `notchspan` can be set directly by the users.
    To have plotly compute them or to show sample points besides the boxes, users
    can set the `y` data array for vertical boxes (`x` for horizontal boxes) to a
    2D array with the outer length corresponding to the number of boxes in the traces
    and the inner length corresponding the sample size.'
